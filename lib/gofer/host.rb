  # A persistent, authenticated SSH connection to a single host.
  #
  # Connections are persistent, but not encapsulated within a shell.
  # This means that while it won't need to reconnect & re-authenticate for
  # each operation, don't assume that environment variables will be
  # persisted between commands like they will in a shell-based SSH session.
  #
  # +/etc/ssh/config+ and <tt>~/.ssh/config</tt> are not recognized by Net::SSH, and thus
  # not recognized by Gofer::Host.
